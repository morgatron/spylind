    "Driving from two field directions at once. Now we completely the leave the SVEA in terms of propagation direction. We model every wavelength. The forward going wave propagates as $e^{ikz}$ and the backward going wave propagates as $e^{-ikz}$. This would mean we'd have to model $>10^4$ waveleneghts for typical media sizes. However, the result is generally the same for thin media as thick, so long as the OD is similar. That is, we can usually get away with modelling a much thinner medium (say 20 wavelengths long) and scaling up the atom re-radiation strength to give the same OD as the large medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason to go to this effort is (I think) to look at the effects of a cavity. To do this is actually just a step further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately the driving field for the atoms will be given by a state dependent value $E_{tot}$ which has contributions from $E_{inp,F}(t), E_{inp,R}$ and $E_{pol}(t, \\rho)$. Each step it's calculating the space dependent polarisation $E_{pol}(z)$, then using this to calculate the forward and backwards moving polarisation due to atoms alone. Then use the final value to calculate the contribution of any extra modes (e.g due to reflections due to a cavity) who's spatial dependence is pre-calcuated. These weighted modes are then summed with the moving polarisation modes to give $E_{tot}(z)$"
