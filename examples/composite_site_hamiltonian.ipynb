    "The ions at each site are identical except ion A has a with slightly lower energy optical transition than ion B. There is a diagonal interaction between the ions, i.e. the energy of the system increases when both atoms are excited at the same time. In this case, to get both atoms excited, we must first excite one, then the other, taking into account the energy due to the interaction.\n",
